# As a developer, I want to use Python’s proper snake_case for variable names.

# As a developer, I want to create a Customer, ShoppingCart, and Product class.

# As a developer, I want the Product class to have class properties to keep track of the Product’s name, price, and category.

# As a developer, I want the Product class’s initializer to take in the initial values for the name, price, and category via parameters

# As a developer, I want the ShoppingCart class to have class properties to keep track of the ShoppingCart’s products (list).

# As a developer, I want the ShoppingCart class to have a method to calculate and return the current total of all products in the cart.

# As a developer, I want the ShoppingCart class to have a method to add a new product to the cart. (Appending to the products list)

# As a developer, I want the ShoppingCart class to have a method to empty all products from the shopping cart.

# As a developer, I want the Customer class to have class instance variables to keep track of the Customer’s name and shopping cart object. (Set the shopping cart instance variable equal to a new ShoppingCart object in the initializer HINT: You will have to import the ShoppingCart class into the customer.py file)

# As a developer, I want the Customer class’s initializer to take in the initial value for the customer’s name via a parameter.

# As a developer, I want the Customer class to have a method to add a new product to the customer’s shopping cart (within this method you will call the shopping cart’s add product method)

# As a developer, I want the Customer class to have a method to view all products in the customer’s shopping cart. (Loop over the shopping cart’s products list and print each product to the terminal)

# As a developer, I want to import the Customer and Product classes into main.py so I can instantiate a customer object as well as three Product objects and interact with the object’s methods:

# 1. Print the customer’s name to the terminal

# 2. Call the customer’s add product to shopping cart method three times and add the three products objects you created

# 3. Call the customer’s view products method

# 4. Call the customer’s shopping cart’s get cart total method. Capture the total the method returns in a variable and print to the terminal

# 5. Call the customer’s shopping cart’s empty cart method

# 6. Check if all products have been removed from the shopping cart
